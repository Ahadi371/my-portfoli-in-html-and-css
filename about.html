        <h1>This is Ahadi Hasan</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ahadi hasan. I read in class 13. I live at Trishal in the
            mymonsingh district. My collage name is Anondo mohon collage. I study
            in the evening from 6.00 pm to 10.00 pm. My favourite subject is
            English. I live with my parents. I am the youngest in my family and I
            have the only elder brother Mehedi and two sisters. They are Shima and
            Rina.
          </p>
          <p> My father is a police officer and my mother is a doctor. There
            both are so much busy but always take care of us. I mostly like to
            play cricket.Because of my academic tenure, I always get good marks
            and grades.</p>
           <p>  I am a merit scholarship holder in my school. I learn
            computer very well in my school and know everything about computer. I
            do everything according to my organized schedule of work. I never
            avoid my any of the works whether at home or at school. I always
            respect my parents and help my mom in her house works and my father in
            his office projects.
          </p>
          <p>We love each other very much and are closely related to grandparents. All family members are open-minded and friendly. I have a group of 5 friends however Shihab is my best friend.</p>
          <p> He is true, honest and looks so nice. We both are in the same class and school.
    
            Normally, I like to hear and tell jokes and stories to my friends.</p>
            <p> I help my younger cousins in doing their home works daily. I love my parents very much. They also love me and promote me to do well in every field. They motivate and inspire me to study.</p>
